Taco Ticker is an idle/clicker game built around the concept of exponential growth. Run main in TacoTickerDriver to start the game.

Ticking the main taco button gives one taco per tick. Tacos can be spent on producers, which automatically generate tacos, and upgrades, which scale production.

Your TPS (tacos per second) is added to your total Number of Tacos once per second.

Upgrade effects are as follows:

Megaphone: Doubles the TPS of Street Stands
Tortilla Press: Doubles the TPS of Taco Shops
Hot Sauce: Doubles the TPS of Restaurants
Assembly Line: Doubles the TPS of Factories
Boardroom: Doubles the TPS of Conglomerates
Constitution: Doubles the TPS of Taco Towns
Lettuce Land: Doubles the TPS of Planet Tacos

Bell: Doubles ALL TPS
The cost of this upgrade is equal to 100,000 + 300 x your current TPS, meaning you will always have to wait in order to buy it.

Taco Making Gloves: Permanently scales the number of tacos you gain per tick to 5% of your TPS
The cost of this upgrade is equal to 10,000 + 100 x your current TPS, meaning you will always have to wait in order to buy it.
